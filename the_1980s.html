  <li><h2>Seagate ST-506 Hard Disk Drive(1980)</h2></li>

  <p>The ST-506 hard disk drive was the first 5.25 inch hard disk drive, introduced in 1980 by Shugart Technology (now Seagate Technology). It stored up to 5 megabytes after formatting and cost US $1,500 ($4,455 in today's dollars). The similar, 10-megabyte ST-412 was introduced in late 1981. The ST-225 was introduced shortly thereafter with 20 megabytes and half the height. All three used MFM encoding, a widely used coding scheme. A subsequent extension of the ST-412 interface used RLL encoding for a 50% increase in capacity and bit rate. The ST-506 connected to a computer system through a disk controller. The ST-506 interface between the controller and drive was derived from the Shugart Associates SA1000 interface, which was in turn based upon the floppy disk drive interface, thereby making disk controller design relatively easy. The ST-506 interface and its variants (ST-412, ST-412RLL) were adopted by numerous HDD manufacturers such that the interface became a de facto industry standards for disk drives well into the 1990s. The limitations of the ST-506 interface is 5.00 Mbit/s transfer rate, 16 heads, 4 drive units and a 20-foot (6.1 m) cable length. Number of tracks only increase the access time.</p>
  <li><h2>IBM introduces its Personal Computer(1981)</h2></li>

  <p>The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. The generic term personal computer was in use before 1981, applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, but because of the success of the IBM Personal Computer, the term "PC" came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's Personal Computer branded products. Within a short time of the introduction, third-party suppliers of peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software proliferated; the influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market was substantial in standardizing a platform for personal computers. "IBM compatible" became an important criterion for sales growth; after the 1980s, only the Apple Macintosh family kept a significant share of the microcomputer market without compatibility with the IBM personal computer.</p>
  <li><h2>CD-ROM is released(1983)</h2></li>

  <p>A CD-ROM is a pre-pressed optical compact disc which contains data. The name is an acronym which stands for "Compact Disc Read-Only Memory". Computers can read CD-ROMs, but cannot write to CD-ROMs, which are not writable or erasable. During the 1990s, CD-ROMs were popularly used to distribute software for computers and video game consoles. Some CDs, called enhanced CDs, hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player, while data (such as software or digital video) is only usable on a computer (such as ISO 9660 format PC CD-ROMs). The CD-ROM format was developed by Japanese company Denon in 1982. It was an extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio, and adapted the format to hold any form of digital data, with a storage capacity of 553 MiB.CD-ROM was then introduced by Denon and Sony at a Japanese computer show in 1984. The Yellow Book is the technical standard that defines the format of CD-ROMs. One of a set of color-bound books that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats, the Yellow Book, standardized by Sony and Philips in 1983, has a capacity of 650 MiB.</p>
  <li><h2>Raspberry Pi, a credit-card-size single board computer is released(2012)</h2></li>
  <img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/themes/mind-control/images/home-products-cta__image.png" width=300 height=200>
  <p>The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.</p>
  <li><h2>Apple Pay is released(2014)</h2></li>

  <p>Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple Inc. that lets users make payments using an iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad or Mac. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific contactless payment terminals, and can work with existing contactless terminals. It takes your credit cards, debit cards, and other sensitive payment data from the wallet app, which allows you to use your iphone, apple watch, or iPad as a form of payment in stores. It is available in the U.S.A., U.K., Canada, Australia, Brazil, UAE, Russia, China, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, as well as various other European Nations. Apple Pay supports most major credit cards, including American Express, Visa , and MasterCard. Supporting banks vary. It works at any stores that use contactless payments (just look for the contactless payment symbol near readers at checkout).</p>
