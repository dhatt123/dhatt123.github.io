  <h1>Hamilton leads busy day as F1 tests resume after snowfall</h1>

    <p>MONTMELO, Spain — Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes led the fourth day of Formula One tests on Thursday, when teams made up for lost time caused by bad weather.<br> <br>
It was a busy day at the Circuit de Catalunya-Barcelona after snowfall and cold temperatures kept most cars in the garage on Wednesday.<br> <br>
Temperatures improved on Thursday for the final session of the week, and teams immediately sent out their cars. Hamilton posted a lap of 1 minute, 19.333 seconds, the best of the week.<br> <br>
"Today has been positive, I’m so happy that I could get in the car and I’m really excited that I could get some running in," Hamilton said. "It’s been the first time that I’ve really been out to learn a lot more about the car and its characteristics."<br> <br>
The British driver was a half-second faster than Stoffel Vandoorne of McLaren, who had his time on the faster hypersoft tires. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, last year’s runner-up in the drivers’ championship, was third-fastest, nearly a second behind Hamilton.<br> <br>
Pierre Gasly’s Honda-powered Toro Rosso led the lap charts with 147. Vettel was next with 120 laps, followed by Vandoorne’s 110. Hamilton ended the day with 69.<br> <br>
"It was really satisfying to have done so many laps," Gasly said. "It was really important for the team and also for myself to be able to learn so much."<br> <br>
Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, the only driver to post a time on Wednesday, was fifth-fastest after running 51 laps with McLaren.<br> <br>
Kevin Magnussen was fourth-fastest with Hass.<br> <br>
The session was stopped briefly in the morning after Marcus Ericsson went off the track in his Sauber. There was another red flag in the afternoon when Max Verstappen went off in a Red Bull.<br> <br>
Drivers still needed wet tires early in the session but conditions improved significantly in the afternoon and drivers were able to finish on dry tires.<br> <br>
Unusually cold weather significantly reduced practice time for the teams this week as the track remained without enough grip for proper runs.<br> <br>
There will be another four-day test session in Barcelona from next Tuesday.<br> <br>
The season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne is March 25.<br> <br> </p>

<h1>Report: Grizzlies sign Canadian Rathan-Mayes to 10-day contract</h1>

 <p>The Memphis Grizzlies have signed Canadian guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes to a 10-day contract, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports.<br> <br>
 The native of Scarborough, Ont., has averaged 16.6 points, 7.2 assists and 6.4 rebounds per game in 39 contests with the G League’s Westchester Knicks this season. He joins fellow Canadian Dillon Brooks on the Grizzlies’ roster.<br> <br>
 Rathan-Mayes played college basketball at Florida State but went undrafted in 2017. He has since represented Canada in international play but is perhaps best known for scoring 30 points in under five minutes in a 2015 NCAA game.<br> <br>
The 23-year-old signed a deal with the New York Knicks last August but was waived prior to the season.<br> <br> </p>

<h1>MLS takeaways: Canadians earn their keep in Whitecaps-Impact game</h1>
<img src=https://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yordy-reyna720.jpg>
<h2>Montreal Impact: 1 & Vancouver Whitecaps: 2 </h2>
<h3>GAME RECAP IN A SENTENCE</h3>
<p>A dull and dire match sprung to life in the second half with three goals in an 18-minute span, including the first ever in Major League Soccer by Canadian teenager Alphonso Davies to give Vancouver the win before a record home crowd.</p>
<h3>THE MAIN TALKING POINT</h3>
<p>The Whitecaps were coming off a very busy winter of activity as they prepared to host the Impact in Sunday’s season opener for both clubs. No less than 17 players were traded, moved or left since Vancouver’s playoff loss to Seattle last November, the latest being central defender Tim Parker, who was traded on Friday to the New York Red Bulls for Brazilian playmaker Felipe.<br> <br>
With so much roster turnover, questions were being raised about how the club would gel and come together on the pitch, and whether the lack of continuity would hurt it. There were a few hiccups on Sunday, most notably the communication between new central defensive pairing Kendall Waston and Aaron Maund, and new starting goalkeeper Stefan Marinovic.<br> <br>
But newcomers Kei Kamara and Mexican midfielder Efraín Juárez seamlessly fit into the starting 11 for a Whitecaps side that bossed and dictated the pace of the game. Kamara opened the scoring and effectively led the line up front in serving as the Whitecaps’ main attacking reference point, while Juárez linked up well with Cristian Techera down the right side.<br><br>
Overall, it was a balanced and cohesive performance by the Whitecaps. Credit must be given to coach Carl Robinson for incorporating his newcomers into the lineup alongside so many holdovers from last season, and for showing faith in Davies in such a big game.<br> <br> </p>
<h3>KEY MOMENT</h3>
<p>Kamara gave the Whitecaps the lead with a header off a beautiful cross into the box from Davies. Seven minutes later, Juárez played a lovely chip pass that released Techera down the right flank, and the Uruguayan cut into the box before squaring the ball into the middle for an unmarked Davies to slot home. It proved to be an important goal – Montreal surged in attack for the final 20 minutes, and managed to make a game of it after Matteo Mancosu scored to make it 2-1.</p>
<h3>TALKING POINT</h3>
<p><strong>What was with all of the Canadian content?</strong> It’s not very often that you see so many Canadian players involved in an MLS match. Six members of Canada’s national team started Sunday’s contest: Davies, Marcel de Jong and Russell Teibert for Vancouver; Michael Petrasso, Raheem Edwards and Samuel Piette for Montreal. None of these six players were on the field simply because this was a Canadian derby – all of them are expected to be key figures for their clubs this season. Davies, especially, could have a breakout year. Robinson was very protective of Davies last year and limited his playing time when the team could have benefited from his dynamic play, but it looks as though the Whitecaps coach is going to unleash the young Canadian this season.</p>
<h3>QUICK TAKE</h3>
<p>You have to hand it to the Impact for the way they thwarted the home side for more than 60 minutes, and for the way they battled back and almost secured a share of the points after going down 2-0. The fact that Montreal was able to stay so organized without its new defensive leader Zakaria Diallo, the club’s major off-season addition who is out with an Achilles injury, made its defensive performance all the more impressive. Also, left fullback Daniel Lovitz showed a real knack for getting forward in attack and delivering dangerous crosses into the box, like he did on Mancosu’s goal. Lovitz nearly set up the Italian again minutes later with another beautiful delivery from the flank.</p>
<h3>STANDOUT STAT</h3>
<p>Sunday’s attendance at BC Place was 27,837, which set a new club record for opening day in MLS. The Whitecaps’ previous best crowd for a season opener was 22,592 fans for their first match in their debut MLS season in 2011.</p>
<h3>MAN OF THE MATCH</h3>
<p><strong>Kei Kamara, Vancouver Whitecaps:</strong> It was a fantastic Whitecaps debut for the Sierre Leone forward, who joined the West Coast club in the off-season. Kamara provided the home side a solid presence up front, as he used his size to effectively hold up the ball and bring his teammates into the game. A noted threat in the air, he opened the scoring with that wonderful headed goal, and continually dropped back to lend a hand in defending. Kamara was deservedly applauded off the pitch when he was subbed out late in the game for his hustle and work rate at both ends of the pitch.</p>
